# GamesEngine1Project
A repository for the submission of my Games Engine 1 module project

My Idea for the project is a generated maze in unity. I hope to be able to start the level and a maze will be automatically made, different to each time it is played, later into the development i may start adding in things to make it more like a little game but to start i just want a program that creates a maze. I got my idea from halloween, thinking about corn mazes they do around then and it fits the requirement of something generated with enough room for some creativity as well.

Also into the development a bit if i get it working I will continue to tinker with it and make it more of a creative experience, IE utilising audio-visuals, colour changing assets, etc. maybe even including some enemies to contend with.
